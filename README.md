# QTrobot-Project
 QTrobot is a humanoid robot built by LuxAI S.A. It is currently in use for the emotional training of children with autism, post-stroke rehabilitation and rehabilitation cognitive and physical of the elderly
 
 We are a team of 3 who have worked on a project that aims to make the behavior of QTrobot more natural. The project therefore aims to provide the robot with a more lively behavior even when he has no work to do. Based on the behavior of a sociable person, it is necessary to make the robot more efficient in terms of interaction with its user and reduce its robotic character. 
 
 For starters, it would be interesting if the robot moves it head and arms a little, like a standing person who is looking at his surroundings. This what the script "Random_moves" aims to do.
Then, The script "Follow_user.py" makes the robot capable of following its user, it was programmed based on the image recognition functions already implemented in its camera NuiTrack. In addition, scripts "Bonjour.py" and "Namasté.py" helps the robot recognize and reproduce some greetings, in particular the waving, a greeting with a swipe up and the Namasté greeting. 

 Finally, bringing together all the functions described previously in a single script, all the fruit of this work can be observed during the same scenario using the script "F_integrale.py".
